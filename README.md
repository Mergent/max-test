# Getting Started with Create React App

Don't forget to write `npm i` before starting work.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Installs packages and their dependencies into the project\

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run dev:server`

Launches a server for development in development mode `npm run start`.\
You need to start the server in a separate terminal. \
The server starts on port 6100, the development mode is sent to the server automatically

### `npm run build`

Bandle an application in order to upload it to the server.\
The build is placed in the `/build` folder.\
CI Gitlab automatically builds the project before it becomes possible to merge a branch, so you donâ€™t have to run a build for each commit
